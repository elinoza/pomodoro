# Pomodoro Tracker

This is a simple Pomodoro Tracker built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The Pomodoro Technique helps you work with the time you have, rather than against it. Using this application, you can enhance your productivity by breaking your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5 in short breaks.

## Features

- **Timer**: Start, pause, and reset the timer.
- **Add Time**: Easily add time to the current interval.
- **Background Color**: Dynamically change the background color based on the Pomodoro phase.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

The Pomodoro Tracker is easy to use. Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the application. You can start the timer, pause it, reset it, and add time to the current interval as needed. The background color of the Pomodoro component changes dynamically based on the current phase of the timer.
